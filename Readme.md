# DSNN 

This is a HTML, CSS, and Javascript practice that I did. The main purpose of this project was to practice my html and css manipulation. The webpage also is paired with pop up alert, and interactive buttons. (Users can click the scores under the team banner to see the numbers increase, the pop up alert is set to a timer so it will pop up after a certain amount of time after refreshing the web page)
No bootstrap was used in this practice.

Can you tell this was done to copy the ESPN website?
